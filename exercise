1.Let's start by figuring out how many dinosaurs we have. Count the number of dinosaurs.

select count(name) from dinos;

2.We want to open up our own version of Jurassic Park, but this time only
with dinosaurs who are actually from the Jurassic period. Find all the
dinosaurs from the Jurassic period.

select name from dinos where period='Jurassic'

3.Find the total sum length of all the dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period.

select count(length) from dinos where period='Cretaceous';

4.Find all the dinosaurs from either the Jurassic OR Cretaceous periods,
 and order them by their species name alphabetically.

 select name from dinos where period='Jurassic' order by name;

 5. Find all the dinosaurs from the t_order Saurischia that are Herbivorous.

 select name from dinos where t_order='Saurischia' and diet='Herbivorous';

 6.Dinosaur names are hard to remember. Find the shortest dinosaur, and rename it Shortie.

 select min(length) from dinos;
 update dinos set name = 'Shortie' where length=0.08;
 select name from dinos where length=0.08;

 7.Find the alphabetically first dinosaur, so we can make sure they're present for class.

 select name from dinos order by name;
 select name from dinos where name like 'Aa%';
